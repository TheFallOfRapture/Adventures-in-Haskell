# Adventures in Haskell
Artifacts from my journey through Haskell.

These files contain the code I've written while trying to learn my second programming language, Haskell. Read through them if you'd like.

(There's another pretty cool repo I've made called First-Game-Engine if you want to check that out, too!)
