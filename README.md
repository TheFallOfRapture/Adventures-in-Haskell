# Adventures in Haskell
Artifacts from my journey through Haskell.

These files contain the code I've written while trying to learn my second programming language, Haskell. Read through them if you'd like.
I typed most of this code while following Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! (http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters), and the rest I typed either following other resources like the Haskell wiki, or hour-long videos about monads and functional programming on YouTube (sleep is for the weak). For example, the Math.Vector module is mostly just me trying to understand monads while compiling together about five different sources of information.

(There's another pretty cool Java repo I've made called First-Game-Engine if you want to check that out, too!)
